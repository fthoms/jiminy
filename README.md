# Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) using Channels
Communicating sequential processes for .NET using channels to synchronize between asynchronous tasks.

It is heavily inspired by the Go programming language.

Much more to come:
*	Documentation
*	Theory
*	Patterns and cookbook

In the meantime take a look at the examples I have already provided in the `Jiminy.Examples` project.

You can also get right down to business and [get the latest nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Jiminy/1.0.0-rc1).

There are a suite of unit tests to verify that the code functions properly. Based on that, and on my own use of the package, it is **quite stable** and performs really well (see the `PerformanceTest` class in the examples project).

However, for now it is still just a release candidate. Let me know if there are any issues, feature requests or other.

Stay tuned - I will update this readme and the wiki when I get the time.
