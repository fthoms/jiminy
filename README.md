# Jiminy
Communicating sequential processes for .NET using channels to synchronize between asynchronous tasks.

It is heavily inspired by the Go programming language.

Much more to come:
    -   Documentation
    -   Theory
    -   Patterns and cookbook

In the meantime take a look at the examples I have already provided in the `Jiminy.Examples` project.

Stay tuned.
